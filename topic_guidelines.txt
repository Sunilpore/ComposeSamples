2] Row, Column and Basic Modifiers
  - width(dp), height(dp)
  - fillMaxHeight(%), fillMaxWidth(%)
  - requiredWidth(dp)
  - paddng(top,left,bottom,right) (dp).
    In Compose there is no margin attribute available
  - offset
   (It is not similar to margin. It changes orientation of applied widget without impacting or affecting its neighbours widgets)

    - Box (for auto-size widget views) , Card widget
    - Use Brush Widget For Gradient

    - Add Font Family and use it
    - Use 'buildAnnotatedString' for providing Spannable effect to Strig character

 6] Compose State
    - use remember, mutableStateOf() methods for state managemnet

 7] Textfields, Buttons & Showing Snackbars
    - Use Scaffold Container to show Snackbar
    - Use TextFields for hint and allow user to enter text
    - Use Button Widget along with scafold state to show snackbar
    - Use remember scopes i.e. rememberScaffoldState,rememberCoroutineScope, etc.
      Also use remember state delegation

 8] Column
    - Use as a replacement of ListView, Recyclerview
    - Column
    - LazyColumn
      I] It will quite faster than Column and no need to define scroll direction as it has by default
